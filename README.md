# CitySmashinCritters
This is my first real attempt at making a game - start to finish. The goal is to make something I could sell and be proud of - not something of poor quality sold to make a few dollars.

The approach is to start by making the initial version of everything - every feature, and don't worry about organization (or even optimization). After an MVP has been reached, everything can be iterated upon, but building upon a game helps when all the features are, in some part, functioning.

## Plan
These are the different stages of development; if you're familiar with the [spiral model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) of development, you could consider each stage as a full cycle.

### MVP - v0.1.0
Letterally have everything in it's most basic form - no matter how primative, it must first exist as a baseline. Once every piece is in place, each piece can then be improved. This needs to be a working executable, though the demo will be very bare bones.

### Prototype 1 - v0.2.0
Refactoring and rebuilding will probably take place (everything being set up, a full picture of the scope can be realized).

### Prototype 2 - v0.3.0
This is where things will get _MEATY_, i.e., adding quality and quantity.

### Alpha
This is where private testing, and some marketing, will begin.

### Beta
Very close to being ready - only fine tuning. Bigger marketing push in this stage.

### Release - v1.0.0

## Tools
Unity - because it's what I know and I want to gain the experience of making a game without having to build an engine first.
