# CitySmashinCritters
This is my first real attempt at making a game - start to finish. The goal is to make something I could sell and be proud of - not something of poor quality sold to make a few dollars.

The approach is to start by making the initial version of everything - every feature, and don't worry about organization (or even optimization). After an MVP has been reached, everything can be iterated upon, but building upon a game helps when all the features are, in some part, functioning.

## Game Engine
Unity - because it's what I know and I want to gain the experience of making a game without having to build an engine first.
